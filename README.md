# Customer Churn Analysis

A Customer Churn Analysis project designed to predict customer churn using Python. The project includes data analysis, visualization, feature engineering, and building a predictive model with a random forest algorithm.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze customer data, visualize key trends, and develop a predictive model that identifies customers at risk of churning. This allows businesses to take proactive measures to retain customers.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Analysis**:
   - Used Python to analyze client data, exploring numerical and categorical variables to understand key factors related to churn.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Created various visualizations to uncover important patterns and trends in the data that may affect customer retention.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Engineered new features to improve model accuracy, providing deeper insights into customer behavior.

4. **Model Building**:
   - Implemented a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict customer churn based on selected features.

## Files

- `customer_churn_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all steps, including analysis, visualization, feature engineering, and model training.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
   - Addressed missing values and encoded categorical features as needed.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted statistical summaries and visualizations to identify trends in customer churn behavior.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Developed new features to enhance the predictive power of the model.

4. **Model Training**:
   - Built a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict churn, achieving high accuracy by tuning hyperparameters and optimizing performance.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open `customer_churn_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and execute each cell to see the data analysis, visualizations, and model training.

## Future Improvements

- **Improved Feature Engineering**: Further refine features to enhance model accuracy.
- **Testing Other Models**: Experiment with additional algorithms such as XGBoost or Logistic Regression for comparative performance.
- **Deploying the Model**: Package the model into a web application for real-time churn prediction.
